/**
 * This class coordinates the relationship between three entities:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Connections:</strong> physical socket connections to remote servers. These are
 *         potentially slow to establish so it is necessary to be able to cancel a connection
 *         currently being connected.
 *     <li><strong>Streams:</strong> logical HTTP request/response pairs that are layered on
 *         connections. Each connection has its own allocation limit, which defines how many
 *         concurrent streams that connection can carry. HTTP/1.x connections can carry 1 stream
 *         at a time, HTTP/2 typically carry multiple.
 *     <li><strong>Calls:</strong> a logical sequence of streams, typically an initial request and
 *         its follow up requests. We prefer to keep all streams of a single call on the same
 *         connection for better behavior and locality.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class act on behalf of the call, using one or more streams over one or more
 * connections. This class has APIs to release each of the above resources:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #noNewStreams()} prevents the connection from being used for new streams in the
 *         future. Use this after a {@code Connection: close} header, or when the connection may be
 *         inconsistent.
 *     <li>{@link #streamFinished streamFinished()} releases the active stream from this allocation.
 *         Note that only one stream may be active at a given time, so it is necessary to call
 *         {@link #streamFinished streamFinished()} before creating a subsequent stream with {@link
 *         #newStream newStream()}.
 *     <li>{@link #release()} removes the call's hold on the connection. Note that this won't
 *         immediately free the connection if there is a stream still lingering. That happens when a
 *         call is complete but its response body has yet to be fully consumed.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class supports {@linkplain #cancel asynchronous canceling}. This is intended to have the
 * smallest blast radius possible. If an HTTP/2 stream is active, canceling will cancel that stream
 * but not the other streams sharing its connection. But if the TLS handshake is still in progress
 * then canceling may break the entire connection.
